  				I am a voracious learner and love to take on any challenge put in front of me. I love coding, video games, traveling, hiking, and playing in the waves at the beach. IPAs and whiskey are my drinks of choice and I certainly don't mind having one. I speak French decently and am in the process of learning Spanish. I also really hate defining myself in a paragraph even though I'm doing it anyways on my own personal site so I guess I'm a conformist!
